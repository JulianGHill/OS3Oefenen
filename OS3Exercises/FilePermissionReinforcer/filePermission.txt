Assum a direcotry with the following files:
$ ls -ls
----rw----  root    wheel   group_only.txt
-rw-r--r--  root    root    public_knowledge.txt
-rw-------  root    root    secret.txt
-rw-r--r--  root    root    secret.txt.pgp
-rwxrwxrwx  nobody  nogroup wiki.txt
$

Create a script that takes a direcotry as input, and is that direcotry:

1.Creates these files if they do not exist;
2.Checks file ownership and corrects when necessary
3.Checks file permissions, and corrects when necessary.

To enable other programs to use your script, make sure to return a non-zero exit code if anything fails.
